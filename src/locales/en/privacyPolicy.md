# Privacy Policy

The protection of your personal data is of the utmost importance to us. We will thus only process your data in compliance with the pertinent legal provisions ([GDPR](https://www.ris.bka.gv.at/GeltendeFassung.wxe?Abfrage=Bundesnormen&Gesetzesnummer=10001597), [2021 Austrian Telecommunications Act (Telekommunikationsgesetz, TKG)](https://ris.bka.gv.at/GeltendeFassung.wxe?Abfrage=Bundesnormen&Gesetzesnummer=20011678)). This Privacy Statement informs you about the most important aspects of data processing within our website. 

## What is personal data?

Personal data is any information that relates to an identified or identifiable natural person. It is essential to note that data is already considered personal data as soon as a natural person can be identified on the basis of the data (e.g., through assignment of a user identifier). Personal data includes, for example, your name, your address, your telephone number, or your date of birth. Statistical information that cannot be directly or indirectly associated with you (such as the popularity of individual pages of our website or the number of users of a page) is not personal data.

## Who is responsible for collecting and processing your personal data?

The Ludwig Boltzmann Gesellschaft collects and processes your data as the responsible entity. For questions and suggestions, please feel free to contact us:

## Server Log Files

To optimize this website in terms of system performance, user-friendliness, and provision of useful information about our services, the provider of the website automatically collects and stores information in so-called server log files, which your browser automatically transmits to us. This includes your Internet Protocol address (IP address), browser and language settings, operating system, referrer URL, your Internet service provider, and date/time. This data is not merged with personal data sources. We reserve the right to check this data retrospectively if we become aware of specific indications of illegal use.

## Storage Duration

We generally store personal data only for as long as we need it to fulfill the purposes described above or due to our contractual or legal obligations. When personal data is no longer needed, we delete it from our systems or anonymize it so that website visitors can no longer be identified.

## Data Sharing

Personal data collected when using the website is generally not shared with third parties, unless it is necessary to fulfill our obligations or is legally/officially required.

Personal data may also be processed by our service providers on our behalf. Processors are in particular IT service providers or providers of other internet and software solutions that we need to operate the website. All our processors generally process data only on our behalf and on the basis of our instructions for our purposes described above.

## Your Rights

You have the right to information, correction, deletion, restriction, data portability, revocation, and objection. If you believe that the processing of your data violates applicable data protection law or your data protection rights are otherwise violated in any way, you can file a complaint with the Austrian Data Protection Authority:
